# StudeHelp
This is the final project for the "Programmation Mobile IOT". To give some context we had to design and build an app from scratch using all previous knowledge learnt during the semester. (_If you're interested, I've got a repo with a list of all projects we made during the semester in this same course [here](https://github.com/Ttiki/university-swift-projects)_
This project is based on the Stonks Life Inc.'s one of  the same name. You can find the real project on github, HOWEVER I have to warn you it's still in development and at the time of writing this README file it's not even started yet! (_If you're interested in the real app Stud'Help, you can follow [this link](https://github.com/Stonks-Life-Inc/EtalonAide) **EVERYTHING IS WRITTEN IN FRENCH!** _)

## What is Stud(e)'Help?

From it's original name Stud'Help (yeah, we didn't notice our wording here...) is an app made for Students to help them financially throughout the month. This app offers a catalog of promotions from local shop specially made for Students. If a Student is interested by a promotion, he can add it to his wallet. He can "subscribe" to certain promotions to get more of the same one.
When the user wants to use his promotion, he can come to the app, chose the promotion he wants to use and a QR code shows up on screen. 
In this app example some functionnalities aren't implemented yet like the map to get a list of local shop near the user, nor images like shop logos or QR codes because I didn't waste time creating ficticious ones just for the presentation. Also, the wallet shows a list of all promotion in our database and not just the one registered by the user!
I won't work anymore on **this** project, I'm happy with the version I've presented even though I would have like to get more time to properly finish it, but I can't spend more time on it and I don't have a Mac to work on. (_Also, I've got other projects I must work on._)
